## What is a Library ?
- A collection of predefined methods, classes or interfaces used for solving common problem.
- Library is the collection of multiple packages
- come either bundled with a language or can be downloaded from the internet and used.

- Examples of libraries -
- Standard libraries: java.lang, java.util. java.io
- 3rd party Libraries : apache commons, twilio, iText

Benefits :
1) Reusability
2) Reduces Programmer's effort
3) Allow a programmer to focus on main problem

eg, ReactJs but it also consider as framework

## What is Framework ?

- Collection of multiple libraries.
- Provides foundation on which we can build our code.
- It provides pre-written common logics so that we can focus on business logic only.
- Provides reusable components.

eg. Spring

Benefits:
- Seeds up development precess
- Secure
- Forces us to follow standard programming practices and thus make our code clean.

### Types of framework
- Front Enf framework :Angular
- WEB Framework was: STRUCTS But is is oudated and spring is now in demand
- Application dev framework: Spring Framework
- ORM Framework: HILBERNATE

## Library vs Framework

- Libraries are focused to a specific task only while a framework has a wide range of functionality and used to build complete application.

- our code calls the library, while in case of framework it calls our code.

## Web Application Architecture

 USER INTERFACE (Front End Application) --> WEB LAYER = BUSINESS LAYER = DAO (Code for DB Access) --> DATABASE

## What Is Spring Framework ?

- Spring is the most popular java framework for building any type of java application.
- Spring is free & open framework handled by VMware
- Spring is developed in modular fashion
  - Modules in spring (there are 21 modules of spring)
  - spring cloud
  - spring social
  - spring JDBC
  - spring core (most recommend to learn it first)
- Commonly used as backend.

## Advantages of Spring
- Frameworks of framework
- Loose Coupling (Use/connect more than one class), Dependency Injection, Inversion of control
- Simplified development
