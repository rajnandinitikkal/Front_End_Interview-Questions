### What is Full-stack Development?
- Full-stack development involves working on both the front-end and back-end of web applications. It includes client-side (frontend) server-side (backend) development.

### Name some popilar technologies used in full-stack development.
- Common technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (for frontend), Node.js, Express.js, Python, Ruby on Rails (for backend).

### Explain the difference between client-side and server-side scripting.
- Client-side scripting scripting in the user's browser.
- server-side scripting runs on the web server. 
- For example, Javascript is a client-side script, while Node.js is a server-side sript.

### Explain the concept og single page Applications (SPAs).
- SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the app. Frameworks like React and Angular are often used to build SPAs.

### What is a database and mention some types of databases used in full-stack development?
- A database is a structuerd collection of data. Types of databases include SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase Firestore).

### How does authentication work in full-stack application?
- Authentication verifies a user's identity. Typically, a user logs in a with a username and password. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a common method used to authenticate and authorize users in full-stack applications.

### What is version control, and why is it important in software development?
- Version control helps track changes to code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. Git is a widely used version control sysytem. For example, you can use GitHub to host and collaborate on your code.

### What is microservices architecture, and how does it differ from a monolithic architecture?
- In a microservices architecture, an application is divided into smaller, independent service that communicate with each other through APIs. In contarst, a 
monolithic architecture has all components tightly integrated into one codebase.

### Explain the concept of DevOps in full stack development.
- DevOps is a set of parctices that combines development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to automate and stramline in software delivery and deployment process. Tools like Jenkins and Docker are often used in DevOps pipelines.

### What is World Wide Web (WWW)?

### What is web browser's developer console, and why is it useful for web deveplopment?
- A developer console is a tool in web browsers that allows developers to inspect and debug wab pages. It's useful for troubleshooting code issues and testing.

### What is cookie in web development?
- A cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user's computer by a website. It's commonly used to store user preferences and secssions information.
- <b>Example</b> Cookies can be used to remember a user's login status on a website.

### What is the Document Object Model (DOM) in web development?
