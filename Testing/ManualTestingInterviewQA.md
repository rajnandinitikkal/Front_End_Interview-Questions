### 1) Test Levels :-> 
   - Component/Unit
   - Component Integration
   - System
   - System Integration
   - UAT

### 2) Diff Between Regression and Retesting 
   
   - Regression Testing: Testing the unchanged parts of the application to ensure that recent changes havenâ€™t broken existing functionality.

   - Retesting: Testing the same defect after it has been fixed to ensure it is resolved.

### 3) What are the most important things you have to consider when you're writing tset cases ? 

âœ… 1. Clear Test Case Objectives
Define what functionality you're testing and why.

Each test case should have a clear purpose.
âœ… 2. Good Test Case Structure
Include:
- Test Case ID
- Title/Name
- Preconditions/ Assumptions
- Test Criteria
- Test Steps
- Expected Result
- Actual Result (during execution)
- Pass/Fail status

âœ… 3. Test Coverage
Ensure you cover all requirements and scenarios: positive, negative, boundary, edge cases, etc.

âœ… 4. Traceability to Requirements
Each test case should be mapped to a specific requirement to ensure all features are tested.

âœ… 5. Reusability and Maintainability
Write modular and reusable test steps to save time when maintaining tests.

âœ… 6. Clarity and Simplicity
Use clear, simple language so anyone (even non-testers) can understand and execute it.

âœ… 7. Avoid Assumptions
Be explicit about inputs, environment, and dataâ€”don't assume any conditions.

âœ… 8. Test Data Preparation
Ensure test data is available and clearly defined for each case.

âœ… 9. Priority and Severity
Identify which test cases are critical and should be executed first.

âœ… 10. Review and Peer Validation
Get test cases reviewed by peers or leads to catch gaps or errors.

### 4) Diff between White Box and Black box 

âœ… White Box Testing
Tests internal code and logic
Requires programming knowledge
Done by developers

âœ… Black Box Testing
Tests functionality without looking at code
Based on requirements
Done by testers/QA

### 5) What is Selenium
- Selenium is a free, open-source tool used for automating web browsers.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
It is mainly used for automated testing of web applications.
Supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Works with multiple programming languages (Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc.).
Can be integrated with tools like TestNG, JUnit, Maven, Jenkins for advanced testing workflows.

ðŸ§ª Common Components:
Selenium WebDriver â€“ Automates browser actions.
Selenium IDE â€“ A Chrome/Firefox plugin for record-and-playback testing.
Selenium Grid â€“ Runs tests on multiple machines/browsers in parallel.

### 6) Tools
- JIRA
- Bugzilla
- Recordil
- Trello
- Postman
- Jmeter

### 7) Differnt Types of Testing

âœ… 1. Functional Testing
Tests what the system does.

Unit Testing â€“ Tests individual units/components (done by developers).

Integration Testing â€“ Tests the interaction between integrated units/modules.

System Testing â€“ Tests the entire application as a whole.

Sanity Testing â€“ Quick check to ensure basic functionality works.

Smoke Testing â€“ Basic test to ensure the build is stable.

Regression Testing â€“ Checks existing functionality after code changes.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) â€“ Final testing by end users before release.

âœ… 2. Non-Functional Testing
Tests how the system performs. Tool used for Non-functional testing is  "JMETER"

Performance Testing â€“ Checks speed, responsiveness.

Load Testing â€“ Tests system under expected user load.

Stress Testing â€“ Tests system under extreme load.

Security Testing â€“ Ensures data protection and access control.

Usability Testing â€“ Tests user experience and interface.

Compatibility Testing â€“ Ensures the app works on different devices, OS, browsers.

âœ… 3. Maintenance Testing
Re-testing â€“ Verifying bug fixes.

Regression Testing â€“ Re-checking for side effects after changes.

âœ… 4. Other Specialized Testing
Exploratory Testing â€“ Simultaneously learning and testing the application.

Ad-hoc Testing â€“ Informal testing without a test plan.

Alpha Testing â€“ Done by internal users before release.

Beta Testing â€“ Done by external users after alpha testing.
