## 12 Principles of Agile 
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Continous Integration and Continous Delivery(CI/CD)

- Agile
  * Supports initiative development cycle with frequent release of working software to obtain rapid feedback from stakeholders.

- DevOps
 * Atomics Build Test and deployment process to achieve continuous delivery of software update ensuring that change are deployable at anytime.

- Integration
 * Establish ci/cd pipelines that ultimate integration testing and deployment task enabling teams to deliver software updates reliably and consistently.

### Automation and Infrastructure aa Code (Iac):

- Agile
  * Promotes simplicity and flexibility in software design and developing processes.

- DevOps
  * Adovocates for automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration management using IAC tools like terraform , Ansible or kubernetes.

- Integration
 * Use IaC practises to manage and version infrastructure configuration alongside application code promoting consistency , repeatability and scalability across environments.
